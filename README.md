# exercise-dashboard
## An exercise dashboard project I'm creating for my exercise habits.

Hello, it's me again.
I recently started picking up the habit of exercising at least two times a week, and I realized I could create an Electron app to manage this with a cool dashboard.
Now, obviously, there's a ton of mobile apps that do this, but:
1. I need this for PC
2. I'm making this an Electron app so that I can run it on a different OS
3. I'll be learning web development which is cool!

If you want, you can run it on your code editor or IDE by doing ```npm start```, although you need NPM to run it. Anyways, use this app however you want it!
